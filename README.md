# Machine Learning & Data Science Portfolio

Hello! My name is Samuel Fernandes. This repository showcases my practical projects in building, training, and evaluating predictive models to solve real-world business problems.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
As a final-semester Systems Analysis and Development student, I am transitioning from foundational data analysis to applied machine learning. This portfolio serves as my specialization, demonstrating my ability to go beyond exploratory analysis and build data-driven solutions with predictive power.

It complements my foundational work, which is documented in my [Data Analysis Portfolio](https://github.com/Samucas0/Portfolio-Analise-de-Dados).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
**Languages:** Python, SQL
**Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (Learning), PyTorch (Learning)
**Data Manipulation & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
**Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
**Tools & Ecosystem:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks

## 📂 Projects
This section will be continuously updated with new machine learning projects.
